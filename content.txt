B — Plain-language walk-through of each step, what it does, and the important tools

I’ll go step-by-step: short plain language explanation, why it’s needed, typical tools, and one-line advice.

Step 0 — Download raw reads (SRA / ENA)

What it does: gets the raw sequencing files (FASTQ) from public archives so you can process them locally or in the cloud.
Why: you need the actual reads to run the pipeline.
Tools: SRA Toolkit (prefetch + fasterq-dump), ENA downloader, or directly from cloud public buckets.
Advice: test on 1–3 runs first; use cloud compute/storage for many/large runs.

Step 1 — Demultiplexing (if needed)

Plain: split samples if the sequencer put many samples into one file using barcodes.
Why: per-sample analysis is needed for biodiversity summaries.
Tools: cutadapt (barcode-based splitting), Illumina bcl2fastq if starting from raw BCL.
Advice: many SRA runs are already per-sample — check metadata.

Step 2 — Quality control & adapter/primer trimming

Plain: remove sequencing artifacts and bad bases so downstream inference is accurate.
Why: leftover adapters/poor bases cause errors and false unique sequences.
Tools: fastp (fast all-in-one) and cutadapt for exact primer trimming.
Advice: keep the QC html report (judges like visuals).

Step 3 — Merge paired reads (amplicon-specific) — optional

Plain: if the two paired reads overlap, merge them into the full amplicon sequence.
Why: full-length amplicon often has better taxonomic signal.
Tools: vsearch, BBMerge, or DADA2’s internal merging.
Advice: if your marker is short and overlaps, merge; if shotgun/long-reads, skip.

Step 4 — Denoising / ASV inference (DADA2)

Plain: transforms raw reads into ASVs — the “clean” distinct DNA sequences present in the sample (one nucleotide resolution).
Why: removes most sequencing errors so you’re working with real biological sequences, not errors.
Tool: DADA2 (R) — gold-standard for amplicon denoising.
Outputs you’ll use later: rep-seqs.fasta (ASV sequences) and seqtab.csv (counts per ASV per sample).
Advice: this step is essential — treat ASVs as your canonical units for downstream analysis. 
PubMed

Step 5 — Baseline taxonomic assignment (reference-based)

Plain: for each ASV, try to find the closest known sequence in reference databases (like SILVA, PR^2, BOLD, GenBank).
Why: when a close match exists, you can give a taxonomic name (species/genus). But deep-sea taxa are often missing.
Fast tools: MMseqs2 (fast, scalable), DIAMOND (for translated searches), blastn (standard but slow).
Advice: use marker-specific and curated marine reference subsets (smaller + more relevant), not full nt. MMseqs2 is excellent for speed and large references.

Step 6 — Embedding-based, reference-free classification (novelty detection)

Plain: convert DNA sequences into numeric vectors (embeddings) using pretrained sequence language models; compare vectors to find relatives even if no exact database match exists. This helps find novel but related sequences.
Why: avoids over-reliance on incomplete reference databases — you can detect clusters of similar unknown sequences that are likely new taxa.
Tools: DNABERT / DNABERT-2 / DNABERT-S (pretrained sequence transformer models) to get embeddings; FAISS to index/search embeddings quickly.
Advice: this is a core AI part of your proposal. DNABERT-family methods have been shown to produce species-aware embeddings that help clustering and novelty detection; use GPU for speed if available, and tune a distance threshold with known data. 
PMC

Step 7 — Clustering & novelty triage

Plain: group the unassigned ASVs into clusters of similar sequences so biologists can inspect clusters instead of thousands of singletons. Rank clusters by evidence (cluster size, read counts, geographic spread).
Why: prioritize what’s most likely to be an actual novel taxon (many reads in many samples) vs. sequencing noise.
Tools: HDBSCAN (density based), UMAP for visualization, scikit-learn for other clustering.
Advice: present top-ranked candidate clusters (with consensus sequences and read-support) — this is what domain experts will follow up with lab work.

Step 8 — Phylogenetic placement (high-value optional)

Plain: place ASVs onto a known backbone tree to infer where they belong in the tree of life (e.g., near which phyla/orders).
Why: even without a database species match, a placement can tell you “this unknown sits inside Cnidaria-like clade” which is useful for ecological inference.
Tools: aligner MAFFT, tree builders IQ-TREE / RAxML, placement tools EPA-ng or pplacer.
Advice: this is computationally heavier but gives stronger taxonomic inferences for top candidates.

Step 9 — Abundance estimation & compositional analysis

Plain: build per-sample reports (which ASVs/taxa are present and their relative abundances), and compute diversity metrics (alpha & beta diversity).
Why: core biodiversity outputs (species counts, diversity indices, ordination plots).
Tools: QIIME2, vegan (R), scikit-bio, pandas.
Advice: always state that abundance from amplicons is relative and biased (PCR, primer bias, copy number). Provide normalized measures and caution.

Step 10 — Dashboard & deliverables

Plain: a UI to show QC, ASV tables, taxonomy assignments, novelty clusters, maps of sampling locations, and downloads.
Why: judges and scientists need readable outputs.
Tools: Streamlit or Dash for a lightweight web app; package with Docker + Nextflow/Snakemake pipeline and example runs.
Advice: include a small test run (3–6 SRA samples) in submission so reviewers can run/review your pipeline quickly.




C — Improvements and practical suggestions (how to make this top-tier for SIH)

Use a hybrid taxonomy strategy: baseline MMseqs2 (fast exact/similarity), then embeddings (DNABERT-family) → if both weak, run phylogenetic placement. This reduces false positives and gives graded confidence (exact match → high; embedding close → medium; only placement → low).

PMC

Curate a marine/deep-sea reference subset: download GenBank/RefSeq sequences labeled as marine/deep-sea (or taxa known from deep sea), cluster them (MMseqs2 cluster) and keep centroids as a compact, targeted DB. This increases relevant hits and lowers compute.

Benchmark with mock communities and negatives: create synthetic mixes (or use published mock datasets) to calibrate sensitivity, precision, and embedding distance thresholds.

Quantify uncertainty: provide confidence scores per assignment (percent identity, embedding distance percentiles, placement likelihood). Present taxonomy at the highest safe rank (e.g., family-level) if species-level confidence is low.

Reproducibility & deployment: wrap the pipeline in Nextflow/Snakemake + Docker/Singularity images; add a small test dataset so reviewers can reproduce results in minutes.

Compute plan: embeddings are faster on GPU; provide two modes — “light” (CPU only, smaller DB) for quick runs and “full” (GPU + full steps) for deeper discovery.

Biological follow-up plan: for top novel clusters, suggest wet-lab validation steps (targeted PCR, longer marker sequencing, specimen collection if possible) — judges like an action plan.
